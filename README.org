* Problem statement

- you want an app-centric Zyre peer discovery mechanism with socket address resolution

- you want to specify addresses abstractly without carrying about  minor details such as IP and port numbers

- you have an application architecture where sockets are created in disjoint components

- you have sockets created in their own threads

- you develop in C++
